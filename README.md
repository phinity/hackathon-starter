Hackathon Starter 
=================
A boilerplate for **Node.js** web applications.

This is a Fork of [Sahat Yalkabov hackathon-starter project](https://github.com/sahat/hackathon-starter). Please see his README for a full description of the core app.

Sahat has done a nice job of fleshing out basic features of a node app, making many of the same choices I have previously in my own projects. My goal was to add additional core features that he has intentionally left out because of an agnostic aproach. This includes a realtime API layer with socket.io and backbone.js.

See the Github page [An Introduction to Node.js and practical solution](http://phinity.github.io/hackathon-starter/)
